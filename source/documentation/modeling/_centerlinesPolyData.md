### Extracting Centerlines of a Model ###

Sometimes it is desirable to get the centerlines of your model. In order to do this
	
	Right click the model "demo" in Data Manager
	Click "Extract Paths" inthe popup menu

This operation takes some time, and it runs at the backend, so you can continue to do other things. After it's done, the centerlines "demo\_centerline\_1" and "demo\_centerline_2" will created and show under the "Paths" in Data Manager.
