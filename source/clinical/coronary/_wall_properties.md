##Wall Properties

For this example, we have assumed the walls are rigid and thus subject a no-slip and no-penetration boundary condition on the flow. More advanced simulations incorporate the wall deformation through a fluid-structure interaction simulation. More information on running deformable simulations in SimVascular can be found through the online documentation.
