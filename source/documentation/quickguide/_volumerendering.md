## Volume Rendering

An additional technique gaining popularity is known as 3D volume rendering. The user defines an opacity transfer function (which can be non-linear) and uses ray casting (or hardware acceleration) to render the 3D volume. It should be noted that 3D volume rendering is the most computationally intensive method of visualizing imaging data and usually requires very high-end graphics cards for decent performance.

Doule click the image data node and the tool "Volume Visualization" shows up. To see the image's volume rendering:

	Toggle on the checkbox "Volumerendering"
	Choose a preset or click the tab "Threshold" or "Bell" to create a custom transfer function.
