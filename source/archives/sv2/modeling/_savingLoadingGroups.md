###Saving and Loading Groups

You can save and load your groups by clicking on the “Save Groups” and “Load Groups” in the Menu Bar (top left).

Find your “demo” project directory and click on it to highlight it in blue. Then in the entry widget enter “groups” to create a folder to store your groups in. All of your groups will be saved under this folder. Click “OK.” Your “groups” folder has now been created and contains the saved groups.

<font color="orange">**WARNING:**</font> If you close **SimVascular** and then reopen it, the first thing you should do is to load your groups. If you don’t do this, and you make a new vessel, your old groups directory may be overwritten!
