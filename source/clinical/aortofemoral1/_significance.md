# Case 1 - Aortofemoral Normal

##Clinical Significance 

Studying the hemodynamics of the vasculature distal to the abdominal aorta may be important in understanding common diseases in peripheral arteries downstream of the thoracic aorta. Diseases in the peripheral vasculature affect millions of people in the U.S and can have a profound effect on daily quality of life. 

Peripheral arterial disease is the build-up of fatty tissue, or atherosclerosis, in lower extremity arteries. By 2001 at least 10 million people in the U.S were estimated to have peripheral arterial disease. The prevalence of peripheral arterial occlusive disease increases with age and can increase to up to 20% of the population in the geriatric population. Up to 4 million people in the U.S suffer from intermittent claudication causing pain in the legs during exercise. Atherosclerotic occlusive disease of the lower extremity arteries is a major cause of walking impairment, pain, ulcerations and gangrene. 

Renal artery stenosis can have a prevalence of up to 45% in selective populations, specifically populations with other vascular disease. Prevalence can be from 1-6% in hypertensive patients to 30-45% in patients with aortoiliac occlusive disease or abdominal aortic aneurysms. It is most often caused by atherosclerosis in the renal arteries and is often undetected until symptoms become severe. The most common symptom of renal artery stenosis is hypertension, which can have significant effects on the entire vasculature. Up to 24% of patients with renal insufficiency, which can lead to end-stage renal disease renal disease, had renal artery stenosis, suggesting that renal artery stenosis may play an important role in kidney failure.
