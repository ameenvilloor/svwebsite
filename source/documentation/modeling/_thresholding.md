###Using Thresholding to Define a Contour

Now let's use the threshold method to create and add contours to the group.

	Click the button "Threshold"
	Two new panels show inside the tool

<figure>

  <figcaption class="svCaption" ></figcaption>
</figure>

The top new panel is to set a preset threshold value. The other new panel is for postprocessing and batch segmentation.

To create a contour using Threshold (interactively):

	Make sure toggle off the checkbox "Preset"	
	Click the button "Threshold" when the threshold panel already shows.
	The button is highlighted in light blue, which means the method is activated for interaction.
	Move the cursor to a 2D view window
	Press and hold the left mouse button at the center of vessel
	Move the cursor up/down. Up: decrease threshold value, down: increase threshold value.
	Relsease the left mouse button when you feel the contour (in yellow) matches the vessel lumen best

</figure>

Notice when you move up/down, the slider "Preset" slider displays the threshold value used to create the contour. After releasing th mouse, the contour is finalized (in red) and added to the group. In this example, the preset value is 62.8. Under Contour List, the new contour is listed with the type and method used for it.

</figure>

When this contour is finalized, two control points are created inside it for shifting and scaling the contour.

To shift a contour (interactively):

	Move the cursor to the central control point and it becomes red (activted)
	Press and hold the left mouse button at the point
	Move the mouse to shift the contour

To scale a contour (interactively):

	Move the cursor to the other control point (conncted to the central point by a short line)
	Press and hold the left mouse button at the point
	Move the mouse to scale the contour

<font color="red">**HELPFUL HINT:** </font>  The control points may look too large or small in 2D/3D-view windows. You can change the size, to do it:
	
	Select all the contour groups you want to change in Data Manager
	Right Click and click "Point 2D Size" or "Point 3D Size"
	Give new size in the popup dialog



The contour may looks a little jagged, you can selecte the contour from the list and click the button "Smooth" to get a smooher contour.

</figure>


With the only two control points, we can't change the shape of the contour. Now we move the reslice position to 30 and create another contour using the same method as above. The only differences are:

	Move the reslice position to 30	
	Toggle on the checkbox "Convert to Spline" in the threshold panel.
	Ctrl No.: 12

<figure>
  <img class="svImg svImgMd"  src="documentation/modeling/imgs/segmentation/thresholdinteractive3.png"> 
  <figcaption class="svCaption" ></figcaption>
</figure>

This time the finalized contour is converted a closed spline with 12 (Ctrl No.) control points along the contour, with two extra control points inside. Now you have severl ways to change the contour shape.

To move a control point (interactively):

	Move the cursor to a control point on the contour and it becomes red (activted)
	Press and hold the left mouse button at the point
	Move the cursor to adjust the point position on the reslice plane

To delete a control point (interactively):

	Move the cursor to a control point on the contour and it becomes red (activted)
	Righ click

To add a new control point (interactively):

 	Move the cursor to the contour line (but on any control points)
	A green control point is created
	Left click and the point is inserted into the contour.

We can also create a contour using a preset threshold value, without interaction.

	Move the reslice position to 60	
	Toggle on the checkbox "Preset" and set the value to 75, in the threshold panel.
	Toggle on the checkbox "Convert to Spline" in the threshold panel.
	Ctrl No.: 12
	Click the button "Threshold"

####Batch Segmentation

Now let's try  create contours in batch model using a preset threshold value.This approach involves pre-selecting the locations for the segmentations, so that only a handful of locations get segmented. This will be faster than generating all of the segmented contours at once. However, it requires user knowledge about which locations are important for the modeling, and it can be especially tedious for vessels with large curvature and/or radius changes. It may also require going back and segmenting other locations later in the process.

	Toggle on the checkbox "Preset" and set the value to 75, in the threshold panel.
	Toggle on the checkbox "Convert to Spline" in the threshold panel.
	Ctrl No.: 12
	Toggle on the checkbox "Batch Mode", List: 80,100,130
	Click the button "Threshold"

<figure>
  <img class="svImg svImgLg"  src="documentation/modeling/imgs/segmentation/thresholdbatch.png">

</figure>

Three more contours are created for reslice positions: 80,100,130.
