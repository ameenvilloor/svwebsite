## Data Manager

Data Manager is normally located on the left side of the main window. It lists and organize all the loaded data in a tree structure. After data is loaded from a file, a data node (representing the data) shows in Data Manager.

To open a file (loading data into Data Manager):

	Menu: File â†’ Open File...

To show/hide data (in Display):

	Toggle on/off the checkbox next to the corresponding data node in Data Manager

When you right click the data node, a menu pops up. It gives you many functions to deal with data nodes. Some functions are only available to data nodes in a certain type.
