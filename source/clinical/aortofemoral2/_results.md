##Simulation & Results
Conservation of mass and Navier-Stokes equations were solved using 3D finite element methods assuming rigid and non-slip walls. The number of time steps per cycle is 3200 with fixed time step size. The simulation was run in cgs units for several cardiac cycles to allow the flow rate and pressure fields to stabilize. Simulation results were quantified for the last cardiac cycle. Paraview, an open-source scientific visualization application, was used to visualize the results. A volume rendering of velocity magnitude for three time points during the cardiac cycle can be seen.

Surface distribution of time-averaged blood pressure (TABP), time-averaged wall shear stress (TAWSS) and oscillatory shear index (OSI) were also visualized and can be seen.
