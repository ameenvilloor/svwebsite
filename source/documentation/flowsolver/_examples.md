## Examples

The first example shown above is a cylinder with parabolic steady flow at the inlet and resistance at the outlet. We continue to use the cylinder in the following examples to explore plug flow, RCR, deformable wall, variable wall properties.

**Example 2** - the cylinder with plug steady flow at the inlet and RCR at the outlet.

**Example 3** - the cylinder with plug steady flow at the inlet, RCR at the outlet and deformable wall with uniform wall properties.

**Example 4** - the cylinder with plug steady flow at the inlet, RCR at the outlet and deformable wall with variable wall properties.
