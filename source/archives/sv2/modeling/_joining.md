###Joining Vessels Together to Create a Model

Once you’ve finished creating the right iliac branch, you will find that it is quite easy to join it to the aorta and make a solid model.

In the group treeview display window, select the groups that you would like to use to create a model and click on the “Use Groups” button under “Solid Model Lofting” to the right of the group treeview display window. Once you have chosen the groups you would like to include in your model (one for the aorta, one for the right iliac), they should have “X” written next to them in the “Use in Model” column of the group treeview display.

Under the “Model → Parasolid → Create Model” tab, click on the “Create Pre-Op Solid” button. Once again, give the model a name. After creating the model, it is possible to save by going to "File Input/Output → Save Model". Choose a file location and the extension .xmt_txt should automatically be added designating it as a Parasolid model.

If you zoom into the bifurcation area of the model, you will find the seam where the two solids were united. You will learn how to smooth out this seam in the next section.You can once again change colors of specific regions by hovering over the solid with your mouse and pressing "p". This will highlight the selected face in the list view. You can then change the color and opacity as before.
