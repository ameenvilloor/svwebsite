# Case 4 - Healthy Pulmonary #

##Clinical Significance 

Pulmonary arteries connect blood flow from the heart to the lungs in order to oxygenate blood before being pumped through the body. The main pulmonary artery (MPA) starts at the right ventricle of the heart and divides into the left (LPA) and right pulmonary arteries (RPA), which branch out into the lungs. The main pulmonary artery in healthy subjects has an average diameter of 2.72 cm. Anatomical differences in MPA diameter have also been documented between genders, with a mean MPA diameter of 2.77 cm for males and 2.64 cm for females.
 
Examples of complications seen in the pulmonary arteries include pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary embolisms. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a chronic disease that occurs when the blood vessels between the heart and lungs narrow and harden, increasing the pressure in the pulmonary arteries. The increased resistance makes it difficult for the heart to pump blood to the lungs, adding strain to and weakening the right ventricle. PAH is a serious condition, with a median survival of less than 3 years if left untreated,causing over 15,000 deaths and 260,000 hospital visits in the United States in 2002.
 
Significant vascular remodeling is observed in PAH patients, with larger proximal pulmonary arteries and more convoluted branches when compared to healthy patients. In a study examining three-dimensional hemodynamics of the pulmonary arteries, PAH patients were found to have an average main pulmonary diameter of 3.5 ± 0.5 cm, where healthy patients had an average of 2.7 ± 0.1 cm. 

A pulmonary embolism is another condition seen the pulmonary arteries, involving one or more arteries being blocked by a blood clot. The blood clots typically originate elsewhere in the body and travel to the pulmonary arteries. The effects of a pulmonary embolism can be quiet severe, with the first sign being sudden death in 25% of pulmonary embolism cases. However, prompt application of anti-clogging medication can help avoid mortality and further complications.
