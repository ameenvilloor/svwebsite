###Copying and Pasting Contours

Another option for creating contours is to copy and paste a contour from another location. This allows you to extrude that shape and is useful, for instance, at the point where one vessel joins up with another vessel. 

<figure>
  <img class="svImg svImgMd"  src="documentation/modeling/imgs/segmentation/copypastecontours.jpg"> 
  <figcaption class="svCaption" ></figcaption>
</figure>

You can copy and paste any kind of contour you have created.

	Select a contour in Contour List
	Click the button "Copy" to copy the selectd contour
	Move the slider "Reslice" to the position that you want to paste to
	Click the button "Paste".
