###Using Groups

Groups are used to organize the 2D segmentations or contours that you create.  You want to have a different group for each vessel that you are creating.  In addition, you might only use a subset of the 2D contours for producing the solid model of the vessel, so for future reference, it’s helpful to save that subset of contours to a new group.

In the Functional Toolbox pane (bottom right), click on the “2D Segmentation” tab. Under the “2D Segmentation” tab, you should see two more tabs: “General” and “Create Vessel”.

Let’s start by creating a group:
 
Under the “General” tab, type in *aorta* in the “Group Name:” field. Then click the button “Create New Group”. In the group treeview display window, a group with the name “aorta” should appear (highlighted in blue):
