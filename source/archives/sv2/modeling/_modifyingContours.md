###Modifying Contours

Let’s say that you have created a segmentation using one of the aforementioned methods, and you are not quite happy with it. There are a number of things you can do to modify your contour to make it more true to the imaging data.

For the purposes of this exercise, we will start by creating a level set contour and then manipulating it. Review [Section: Using Level Sets to Define a Contour](#modelingLevelSet), and create a level set contour at any position along your path. Make sure you have “Display Options → Level Set → segmentation” checked in the 2D display windows so that you can visualize the changes that we will make to this segmentation.

Under the “Create Vessel” tab, choose the “Smooth” tab:

**Fourier Smoothing:**

Under the heading “Level Set Additional Slice Manipulations”, enter a value of “4” in the field next to “Fourier Smooth:”.  Then click on the button labeled “Fourier smooth.”  This function works similar to the Fourier smoothing used in for path planning. A small number means that **SimVascular** will use fewer Fourier modes in the smoothing process, so a smoother contour will be produced:

**Scaling:**

To make the contour larger or smaller, enter a scale factor into the field next to “Scale by:”, and click on the “Scale by” button.  

Scaling operates on the current contour.  This means that if you apply a scale factor of 2 to the original contour and then apply another scale factor of 2, you will end up with a contour that is 4 times the size of the original contour. The following image shows the previously smoothed contour enlarged by a scale factor of 2:

</figure>

You can get back to the original segmentation by scaling by a factor of 0.5.

**Translating:**

You can move the contour to a different location by specifying “dX” and/or “dY” and then clicking on the “Translate by:” button.  The units are the same as the imaging data, mm in this case. 

The values for “dX” and “dY” are incremental!  This means that the movement occurs relative to the current position.  To see this, enter “5” in the field for “dX”, and click on the “Translate by:” button and note where the contour is.  Click on the “Translate by:” button again and notice that the contour has shifted another 5 units, so that total distance moved relative to the original position is 10 units.

Positive values for “dX” shift the contour to the right while negative values shift the contour to the left. Positive values for “dY” shift the contour up while negative values shift the contour down.

Shift your contour back to center by translating “-10” in the dX direction.

**Fitting Circles:**

Another way to smooth your contour is to fit a circle to the area of the current segmentation. This technique is especially useful when the vessel is quite small and hard to define or you need a circular outlet for a specific boundary condition that you are using in your flow simulation.

Under the “Level Set Additional Single Slice Manipulations” heading, click on the “Fit Circle” button. Your contour should re-appear as a perfect circle:

<font color="orange">**WARNING:**</font>  You cannot undo pasting or circle fitting. You should be sure that you want to fit a circle otherwise you will lose the segmentation that you are creating a circle for and you cannot retrieve it. You must generate the original segmentation again if you fit a circle and realize that the circle does not fit the vessel as you expected.
