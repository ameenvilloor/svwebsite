## GUI Layout 

The SimVascualr main window is composed of a title, a menubar and toolbars (on the top), a status bar (on the bottom), and tool panels (in the middle). Each tool panel is a container which can include several tools. **You can click a tab to show the corresponding tool, or drag-drop a tag to another place to relocate the tool.**
