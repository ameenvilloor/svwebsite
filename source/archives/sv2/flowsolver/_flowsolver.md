## Flowsolver (svSolver)

**svSolver** is the flowsolver for SimVascular simulation. The **svSolver** program is called either using the **SimVascular** GUI or from the command line (in terminal). The input files to svSolver contain a complete description of model geometry,material properties, initial condition, boundary condition, and various parameter to control simulation. We will review this process briefly by keeping using the above cylinder example. First make sure the project folder is the example folder (.../cylinder)
