##Coronary Anatomy

There are two main coronary arteries that branch off from the aorta. They are typically referred to as the left main coronary artery (LCA) and the right main coronary artery (RCA). The left coronary artery further branches into the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and the left circumflex (LCX). The left coronary artery primarily perfuses the left side of the hear (i.e. the left ventricle and atrium) and the right coronary artery primarily perfuses the right side of the heart. Many smaller vessels that branch off these main vessels are often found, especially in high resolution CT image data.

##Image Data

Coronary imaging is typically done with CT, though some centers may perform MRI. Medical images of the coronaries may or may not include the aortic arch. In the example given here, the image data is cut off at the root of the aorta, so the corresponding model only contains the aortic root and the coronary arteries. The heart chambers are typically not included in the anatomic models, and thus an inflow condition is applied just distal to the aortic valve.
