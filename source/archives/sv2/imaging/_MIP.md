##Creating a Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP)

To create a Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP), which may be thought of as a “flattened 3D image” or something similar to an “x-ray image”, select the "MIP" tab in the Display Options pane (top right corner).  Click on "Coronal MIP", and a new “SimVascular Graphics Window” should appear as shown below (be sure to play with the window level by clicking inside the graphics window and using the up/down and left/right keyboard arrows).

  <img class="svImg svImgXl"  src="documentation/imaging/imgs/MIP/1.jpg"> 
  <figcaption class="svCaption" ></figcaption>
</figure>

Click on the "Do not display" radio button to hide the window displaying the MIP.
