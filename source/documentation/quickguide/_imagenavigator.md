## Image Navigator

Image Navigator is normally located on the left-bottom of the main window. The volume dataset we are using for this demo is 512 x 64 x 512 voxels. You can change the location of each slice plane by moving the sliders in Image Navigator. The “Sagittal” refers to left/right direction; “Coronal” refers to posterior/anterior direction; “Axial” refers to inferior/superior direction.
