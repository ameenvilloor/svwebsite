### Extracting Centerlines of a PolyData ###

Sometimes it is desirable to get the centerlines of your model. In order to do this, navigate to the "Model → PolyData → Centerline Extraction"

  <figcaption class="svCaption" ></figcaption>
</figure>

        Highlight the desired model in the list and then click "Extract Centerlines"
	A window should pop up asking you to select the walls of your model. Highlight ALL of the walls of your model and then hit "Enter" on your keyboard
	Wait for a while as it can take some time to generate the centerlines
	When done, the centerlines will be visualized on the screen

Toggle the viewing of the centerlines and the voronoi diagram of the model. These can also be saved as polydatas and click the Save buttons to do this.

In the end, it is also possible to convert these centerlines to SimVascular pathlines to alternatively use as guide lines for 2D segmentation. Click "Convert Centerlines to Pathlines" in order to do this.
