## Presolver(svPre)

**svPre** is the preprocessor for **svSolver**. The input files to svPre contain a complete description of the discrete model: nodal coordinates, element connectivity, element adjacency information and connectivity of boundary nodes and elements. Running **svPre** with an input \*.svpre file with the appropriate commands, generates the input files for **svSolver**.

The **svPre** program is called either from the command line (in terminal) or using the **SimVascular** GUI. The input files for **svPresolver** are those generated by **Simvascular Meshing Module**. We will review this process briefly with a simple example of steady flow through a cylinder (Example 1). Before we start, first set the project folder as the example folder (.../cylinder)
