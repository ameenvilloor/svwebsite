##Model Description

The models extend from the main pulmonary artery to various levels of branching in the left and right pulmonary arteries. Using Simvascular and the image data above, the geometrical models are generated by selecting centerline paths along the vessels, creating 2D segmentations along each of these paths, and then lofting the segmentations together to create a solid model.  A separate solid model was created for each vessel and Boolean addition was used to generate a single model representing the complete aortofemoral model. The vessel junctions were then blended to create a smoothed model.
