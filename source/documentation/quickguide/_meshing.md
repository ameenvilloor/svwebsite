##Meshing

Discretization, also known as grid or mesh generation, is defined as the process of breaking up a physical domain into smaller sub-domains (usually called elements). Discretization is necessary in order to facilitate the numerical solution of partial differential equations. **SimVascular** provide two ways for meshing.
